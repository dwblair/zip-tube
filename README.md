zip-tube
========

This design came out of the MIT Media Lab Breast Pump Hackathon, and is Licensed under the [CERN Open Hardware License 1.2](http://www.ohwr.org/documents/294a
) 

An easy-to-clean piping / tubing design.  After using the zip-tube as a pipe, you can open it up and wash the inside.  Heavier plastics could be used to make the tube robust in dishwashers and using other sterilization procedures.

**Problem** -- sterile transport for fluids.

**Solution** -- zip-tubing!

Note: in the below photos, the ends of the 'zip-tube' are open, and can be connected (via special connecters, yet to be designed) to various nozzles and etc.
