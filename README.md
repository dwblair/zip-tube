zip-tube
========

An easy-to-clean piping / tubing design.

*Problem* -- you want to transport a fluid (breastmilk, say) from one location (a breast, say) to another location (a breastmilk container in a backpack, say).  But typical plastic tubing is very difficult to clean!

*Solution* -- zip-tubing!  

In the below photos, the ends of the 'zip-tube' are open, and can be connected (via special connecters, yet to be designed) to various nozzles and etc.
